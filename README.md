# Virat Kohli Career Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of the cricket career of one of the world's greatest batsmen, Virat Kohli. Using a detailed dataset of his match-by-match performance, I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key statistics, career milestones, and performance trends over time.

The goal of this project is to showcase data visualization and storytelling skills by turning raw cricket data into meaningful insights.
